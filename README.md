The project reads musician and instrument data from text files, 
organizes this data into a binary tree and a musicians database, 
and matches musicians to performances based on specified requirements. 
It efficiently assigns musicians to performances while considering their availability and cost. 
The result is a detailed plan for musical events with optimal musician assignments.
